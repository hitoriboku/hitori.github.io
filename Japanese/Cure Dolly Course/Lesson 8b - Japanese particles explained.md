Here we shall actually explain what a **logical** particle is.

With the exception of の it is a *detective*, it interrogates nouns. **logical particles** mark the **structural functions** of nouns in a sentence. **non-logical** topic marks just flag topics, and tell us nothing about strucutre.

## Logical Particles

These **always** attach a noun

が、を、い、へ、で、（の）

- が is the chief detective, it can work in both **is** sentences and **does** sentences. All the other logical particles can only work on **does** sentences, that is, sentences that end with a verb engine.
	
	This asks a fundamental question, **who** or **what** did it?

- を asks, **who was** it done to? Who was the receiver of the action?

- に asks where, did it go?

- へ asks which direction?

- で asks where was it done/by what means?

Example: (で　with where)

If we want to say "I am in the park", it is simple, namely 公園にいる　（こうえんにいる）

But if we want to say "I am playing in the park", we remember that the core sentence here is still ０がいる, we are modifying いる with 遊んでいる (あそんでいる) to state that we are currently playing, hence why this comes last. But we want to specify that we are doing this in the park! Hence we must say

公園で遊んでいる - こうえんであそんでいる

Example: で now as a means

Even though it seems unnatural in English, it is perfectly reasonable to say

日本語で話す

"By the means of Japanese, I speak"

or more naturally "I speak **in** Japanese"

although it is a perfectly reasonable sentence to also say

日本語を話す

Where 話す＝はなす＝to speak
