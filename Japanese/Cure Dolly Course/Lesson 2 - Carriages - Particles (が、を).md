# The Invisible carriage - the zero が
This is sort of the equivalent of 'it'. We don't say "The ball is red. The ball rolled down the hill. The ball touched the man's foot." etc. Instead it is more natural to say in English "The ball is red, it rolled down the hill, and it touched the man's foot." The use of 'it' here serves a similar function to that of が. Since we already have the **context** of what we are talking about, *the ball* being the case in this example.

When context is obvious, if we want to refer to something one can use the zero が. Which we shall sometimes denote for obtuse purposes as ０が. The whole point of this is that it is not there!

Example:

ドリイ―だ

This is really

(0が)ドリイーだ。

Since the context is obvious that we are talking about the thing which Dolly is.

# The wo carriage
This is not part of the core train, but this is the 'object' of the sentence, the noun we are doing something to.

Example: "(I) eat cake" (where (I) denotes that the context of who is doing the thing is obvious, and thus often omitted)

ケーキを食べる　（食べる＝たべる）

This is with the ０が omitted, we could be more obtuse about this and write

０がケーキを食べる

The actual core of this sentence is still ０がたべる, namely that 0 (assumed to be I via context) eats. However, we want to be more specific, hence why we also say **what** they eat!

If we wanted to be more specific (noting that this is unnatural in common speech), we would write something like

私がケーキを食べる。

To specifically say "I eat cake".
