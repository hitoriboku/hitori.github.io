The core of negation in Japanese is the **adjective** ない. Which simply attaches the state of "not-exist" to something.

# Negation as an adjective
One might ask why ある is a verb to state existence, while ない is an adjective, well this is because nothing is happening! If nothing is being done, we shouldn't assign it to be a verb! Hence it becomes an adjective.

## Negation of nouns

ぺんがない

means

"The pen does not exist".

How about "This is not a pen?" This is a different type of sentence.

One would often say for existence:

これは０がぺんだ, 

i.e. これはぺんだ。 If we are not being obtuse.

To negate this naturally, we want to change the topic of the sentence

これはぺんでは＋ない

"as for the subject of this (０が - the subject of the sentence) being a pen, it isn't"

which in more natural English translates to "This is not a pen".

What we notice is that で is in fact the て form of だ (which asserts being). So it is clear that we are saying "on the subject of the being of this as a pen", hence why we end with は also. (Since we are marking the topic).

So the core takeaway here is if we have a noun, we negate it with +ではない (although from the above discussion, its a little more complex)

Also note that **sometimes**, では is abbreviated as じゃ, hence how we get じゃない.

# Negation of verbs
Besides the て and た forms of verbs there are **no** conjugations in Japanese (really). What they do is become a **sticky stem** to other words. Once we understand this we will be able to understand negation of verbs. But also be able to perform many more conjugations with verbs!

We will detail this in [['Conjugations' of verbs]]

To negate a verb we need to put it in the あ stem and then add ない

So for Godan verbs

買う→買わない (かわない)
話す→離さない (はなさない)
聞く→聞かない (きかない)
etc.

But for Ichidan verbs, they are always simple! We just, drop the る and add whatever we want!

So 食べる→食べない.

# Negation of adjectives themselves
Previously we discussed negation purely as an adjective in and of itself, but now we discuss how to negate adjectives themselves. This leads us to discussing how to make **adjective stems**

Simply **remove the い and replace with く**

Thus to negate 赤い (あかい) we create its **adjective stem**+ない
i.e.

赤く＋ない

赤くない。

"is-not-hot"

(comment: There are  な adjectives, these we do either ではない or じやない - curious to see how this plays out... well きれいな　（綺麗な) is a pretty **interesting** example since　きれい is an adjective in its own right, きれいな is modifying something making it behave like a noun... unsure ow to deal with this)

[Relevant reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/vbq24g/language_models_iadjectives_and_naadjectives_vs/#:~:text=Cure%20Dolly's%20model%20suggests%20that,that%20other%20nouns%20don't.)

It turns out this is actually a point of debate from the above link. Cure dolly would probably say something like 綺麗（きれい）is somehow, actually just a noun, since it can be turned into きれいな to modify a noun, or one could just say "well look at the reading, its all kanji and there's no い!". It seems like by all means, きれい is an adjective, but its an adjectival noun, hence why it satisfies noun negation rules and not adjectival negation rules. Making the notion of a な adjective hold a bit more weight. (Although the actual underlying linguistic concept seems a little different and much deeper.)
# A brief introduction to the て form of adjectives.

This is in fact related to the て form of adjectives, just as we do with verbs, we can do the same with adjectives.

For instance 赤い would become 赤くて etc.

This is in fact the reverse of what happens with く verbs in て form (recall 歩くwould become あるい(て)... etc for the て form, such as in 歩いている)

This is usually when we want to glue an adjective to another. In fact, this hints at the fact that て is kind of like a gluing particle.
# Past tense of adjectives

While we're at it, lets do the past tense of adjectives. Instead we drop the い and add かった.

For instance

怖い (こわい) becomes

怖かった。

"was-scary"

As ない is also an い adjective, if we want to say they didn't do it in the past, we might say something like

桜が＋走ら＋なかった

Sakura didn't run (in the past).

This is because saying Sakura isn't running in the non-past tense, it would be would be

桜がはしらない

where we have used the fact that 走る is a Godan verb ending in る, thus its ending changes from る to ら if we want to make it a stem, and it attaches to the ない adjective to indicate negation, so in the non-past it becomes 走らない. Then we may apply our rules for past tense, ない is an い adjective and so we drop the い and turn it into かった, giving はしらなかった for "did not run in the past".

# Present tense in the past
How do we say "Sakura was running"?

Well we know that 桜が走っている is the present continuous tense for "Sakura is running", so if we want to put that in the past, we simply should put いる in the past, i.e. just put it in its た form. Since いる recall that this is an Ichidan verb, making this quite easy, いる in the past becomes いた. Hence we have

桜がはしっていた

"Sakura was running".

If we want to say "Sakura is not running (now)" in the present continuous tense, we would take the affirmative

桜がはしっている

and negate いる. But いる is an ichidan verb, making this quite simple! We remove the る and then add what we want!

So "Sakura is not running" (currently) becomes

桜が走っていない

and "Sakura was not running" means we needs to take this current present negated statement, and place ない into the past. That is drop the い and replace it with なかった. Hence we get

桜が走っていなかった。

# Two exceptions
The only real exception to a verb being modified with ない to negate it is the verb ます. This is simply a **formality helper** verb. This is something we add onto the え stem of a verb to make it formal. Nonetheless, this is besides the point.

If we have some formal verb ending in ます, to negate it we do not write まさない, but instead write ません, this is just because it is a formal, old-fashioned verb and using old Japanese conventions.

Furthermore, the adjective いい has an an older form よい. When we transform いい, at all, we use this older form.

That is いい→よくない for (not good) or よかった for was good. These are the only to exceptions.
