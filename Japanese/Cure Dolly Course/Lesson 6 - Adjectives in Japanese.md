Every form of sentence we have encountered so far can in fact work as an adjective.

**There is a worksheet for this - but it seems inaccessible at the time of me writing these notes**
# Adjectival sentences

Of course we have our "adjectival" sentence being the obvious case, e.g:

ぺんが赤い - ぺんがあかい

The pen, has the state of being "is-red", 赤い.

But we can use 赤い as a "white engine", i.e. an **adjectival modifier** to some noun. For instance

赤いぺん

This sentence isn't complete! We've just stated that the noun, pen, has the state of being "is-red", but we need to say something about it. If we want some semblance of a sentence we need が and then something to end the sentence. So we must say more.

So we might have something like

あかいぺんが小さい

That is, the red pen is now 小さい (ちいさい). That is, it has the adjective attached to it **is-small**.

# Verbial Adjectives

A standard verb sentence can be rearranged, so that the verb acts as an adjective. For example,

少女が歌った （しょうじょがうたった）

is "The girl sang" in English.

However, we can reverse the order and say

歌った少女が

So we are saying, "The girl who sang", treating the verb as an adjective here. Now again of course, as before, this sentence isn't done! We need to say something more to complete a full sentence. For example

歌った少女が寝ている。

"The girl who sang, is sleeping"

It is useful to break this into parts, we have

歌った少女が＋寝て＋いる

We have the noun, modified by the adjectival verb, 歌った少女. Now what are we saying about her? Well, she is doing the act of sleeping, but its happening right now! So we need to conjugate into the present tense. This means placing the verb into its て form and adding いる to be able to claim that it is happening right now.

### Another example

Another sentence we can play around with is

犬が辞書を食べた。

犬＝いぬ＝dog
辞書＝じしょ= dictionary
食べた＝ate

"The dog ate the dictionary"

We can change this to

辞書を食たた犬が。。。 (again we need more to the sentence)

For instance

辞書を食べた＋犬が＋やんちゃだ。

The dog (which ate the dictionary) is naughty, the part in brackets here being the adjective modifying "the dog".

やんちゃ＝naughty

But here we are modifying 犬 with 辞書を食べた and then saying that is going to do something. The important thing here is always to look out for が! It is the core of any Japanese sentence.

Or one could say

犬が食べた辞書

to mean "the dictionary that was eaten by the dog". However in this case, 犬が食べた becomes an entire adjectival modifier for the word 辞書 So we need much more in this sentence. For example

犬が食べた辞書+が+赤い

Which is "The dictionary that the dog ate+ is red

# Nouns as adjectives
Finally we can turn nouns into adjectives. Instead of 犬がやんちゃだ。We can turn this around by turning だ into な. な is in fact the **corrective form** of だ

For example we can have

やんちゃな犬が。。。

"The naughty dog... (rest of sentence)"

Such as

やんちゃな犬が寝ている

"The naughty dog+is sleeping."

However, we **can't** do this with every noun. We can only do these with what are often called **na-adjectives**. If we don't have a na-adjective then we can still use a noun as an adjective, but now we have to introduce the particle の. This particle indicates possession by someone.

For example, の functions as follows:

桜のドレスが赤い

"Sakura's dress is red"

If we want to use の for adjectives, we need to relate the noun to the class of objects it belongs to.
For instance, if we want to say that a dress is pink (ピンク色) which is not a な-adjective like 好きな (is pleasing to me), we have to use の.

For example

ピンク色のドレスが高い。

"The dress (which belongs to the class of pink-coloured objects) is expensive."

# The の particle

The remarks above hold more generally, namely with all three types of sentences, adjectives, nouns and verbs, if there is not some already known type of conjugation to make it adjectival, we can always use the の particle to make it a "white engine" which acts as an adjectival modifier to an object in a sentence.

Where you do this will be purely something you learn through experience and memorisation. There's no hard and fast rules. Nonetheless, any speaker will understand you whatever you do here since there's nothing really to get confused with. Things might just feel off or not correct to them if you are not using the conventions they use!
