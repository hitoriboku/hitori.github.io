## The あ stem

We can shift all the kana to the あ stem and obtain

This is the **only** stem with an exception where verbs with あ before their dictionary ending う sound, become わ not あ, this is simply because it doesn't make much sense to say 買ああない instead of 買わない, which just... sounds better.

This stem is used for
- negation ない
- permission or obligation させる
## The い stem

The い stem can be used to turn verbs into nouns, but also has many other functions

Helper verbs that use this stem:
すぎる (過ぎる) (to exceed or surpass)

The い stem on a verb usually just makes it a noun
(there is another use - to be covered later)
