There is a simple underlying structure to Japanese sentences:

The main car: A
And the engine: B

Any should fundamentally be of the form A->B.

In any type of language ever, there are only **two** types of sentences:

- A **is** B
- A **does** B

we can make them more complex, but that's about it.

Now we can assign A, and assign B. But we need something to connect them! In Japanese, the key object which does this is が. Sometimes we won't see it, sometimes we will be more complicated etc. but fundamentally, this is the most important thing.

# Verbs
If one is *doing* something (a verb), we end the sentence with (in the most basic form) an う sound. Now of course this doesn't literally mean the character う. But we would have something like 食べる、歩く etc. There is an 'u' sound on the end.

For example, if we want to say "Sakura eats"

we would say

さくらが食べる                             （食べる＝たべる）
# Is (Noun)

Let's suppose we want to say "Sakura is Japanese". The basic (informal) structure would be 

さくらが日本人だ。

We think of が as attached to the 'main car', **A**, namely さくら.  We should think of だ as a one-way equals sign. (Or more appropriately subset?) In this case it means Sakura (さくら) has the value of being Japanese (日本人). However of course, not all Japanese people (日本人) are Sakura!

# Is (Adjective)

The one other form an 'is' sentence can take is a third type involving an adjective (things that invoke a quality of something). Most adjectives in Japanese end in い.

Again, we attach the particle が to our main car, the engine of the sentence will be our adjective, and unlike the previous type of sentences, we will **not use** だ. This is because the adjective is not "red", but in fact is something more akin to "is-red", the equals sign is contained in the adjective!

For example, suppose we want to say "The pen is red". We would say

ぺンが赤い　　　　　（赤い＝あかい）

Again we think of this as

A: (ぺンが) B: (あか)い

# Summary

To summarise, we essentially have **three** types of Japanese sentences, ultimately serving **two** functions when mapped onto English. To relate **A** and **B** by association (is), or to relate them by function (does).
