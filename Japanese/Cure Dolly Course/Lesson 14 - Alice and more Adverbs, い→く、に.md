to do

turning (い) adjectives into adverbs is quite easy, we simply turn the い and turn it into く

早い(はやい)→早く-

穴=あな=hole
込む=とぶ=to be thrust into

we turn a **noun** (or noun-type word) into an **adverb** by adding に
for example, consider 静かな夜, the 'noun' here being 静か. People claiming things about Cure Dolly would say that this is actually a noun, others would just say its an adjective (and probably Cure dolly herself) behaving like a noun (an **adjectival noun**) since it doesn't have its connector particle attached, regardless, it behaves as a noun, so it we want to make it an adverb (e.g. "walk quietly) we add に.

For example 静かに歩く becomes "to walk quietly"

も  is the only other non-logical topic particle. It marks the topic of the sentence just like は, but it cannot create a topic in a conversation like は does, it is only used to **change** the topic to a new object and relating it to the previous topic, typically by similarity, a positive comparison. Meanwhile, は would often be used for some sort of **distinction**.

The third adverb we encounter are nouns that can be applied as an adverb, in such a case we don't need to attach it to anything by any means, we just squish the noun there!

e.g: ゆっくりゆっくり落ちた (落ちた＝おちた=０がfell)
