Recall from the [[Lesson 4 - Tenses]] that we need to be able to conjugate verbs in their て・た forms, precisely how we do this is the subject of this lesson.

There are three groups of conjugations to place a verb in its て or た forms, from which we can then talk about the present and past tenses.

Besides conjugation into the て and た forms, there is a perfectly regular system for any other conjugation of verbs in other situations. Everything is (at least claimed) to be perfectly logical fitting into these two groups!

# Ichidan
Ichidan verbs are called as such since there is only **one** way to conjugate these

These are often referred to as 'iru/eru' verbs

These always end in kana from the い or え kana rows + る in the dictionary (non-past tense) form of the verb.

So they needn't specifically end in the kana いる/える, but can be verbs that end in:

い：りる、みる、ひる、にる、ちる、しる、きる、いる
え：れる、める、へる、ねる、てる、せる、ける、える

Transforming these are **extremely** simple. We simply **drop the る!** and switch it out with whatever we need to depending on the context. So if it was in the て, we'd replace the る with て, that's it!

For example たべる becomes たべた, if we want to put it in the た form (and hence past tense)
# Godan
Godan verbs have **five** distinct ways of conjugating themselves, although realistically there is only four. 

These have to end in う、つ、る｜ぬ、ぶ、む｜く、ぐ｜す, as such there can be Godan verbs, 'masquerading' as Ichidan verbs, i.e. verbs we might think are Ichidan which are really Godan

Unlike Ichidan verbs though, we don't have to end in the above listed endings from the kana chart before る. There are other sounds that can be made, namely ある、うる and おる (not necessarily these characters I guess, but just these vowels before る), thus we can identify some Godan verbs very easily this way. Most verbs which don't fit into this category are Ichidan verbs, but there are some Godan verbs still in this category.
## う-つ-る group
うつる means to move from one thing to another, just what we're doing here! Moving our verbs from one type to another. The way we conjugate this to the て form is as follows, taking off the う、つ or る and replacing it with the って. Likewise, the た form replaces it with った.

So we have

う、つ、る → って (て form) and → った (た form)

For example
笑う (わらう) → 笑って (て form) or 笑った (た form)
持つ（もつ) → 持って (て form) or 持った (た form)
取る (とる) → 取って (て form) or 取った (た form)
## ぬ-ぶ-む group
If one wants a mnemonic, they could call this the NEW BOOM group

These are verbs which end in a bunch of **dull** sounds, namely ぬ,ぶ and む.
In fact, there is only **one** verb ending in ぬ, namely　死ぬ　(しぬ). With that out of the way, lets discuss how to conjugate them, one simply drops the ending ぬ、ぶ or む, and replaces it with

ぬ、ぶ、む→ んで　for the て form and → んだ for the た form.

For example:

死ぬ → 死んで (て form)
飲む → 飲んだ (た form)
## く-ぐ group
These two are so similar, they really should be in the same category, this is what we do here! Nonetheless, the name Godan stuck, counting 5 groups.

This is simple, we cut off く and replace it with いて for the て form, and いた for the た form.

ぐ is quite similar, we cut it off, and replace it with いで for the て form and いだ for the た form.

Example:

歩く（あるく) → 歩いて (て form) and 歩いた  (た form)

泳ぐ (およぐ) → およいで (て form) and 泳いだ (た form)
## す group
A mnemonic for this is SUSHI, SU-SHI!

The last group is simple, drop the す and replace it with して for the て form, and した for the た form.

Example:
話す (はなす) → 話して
ます (formal helper verb) → まして (て form) and ました (た form)
# Irregular 
These are the leftovers and there are **only** two.

来る (くる) and する. 

The て form of 来る is:
The た form of 来る is:
－いって、－いった

meanwhile

The て form of する is:
The た form of する is:
した, して

There is also one other exception which occurs, namely 行く (いく) since it conjugates to いって・いった (行って・行った), but if we followed the rules correctly we would get いいて・いいた, so adding the small っ is simply a contraction of what the rule logically should be. It also means we won't confuse it with a conjugation like いて and いた for iru.
