## The philosophy of Japanese sentences

English is very ego centric, it always want to have an actor. Meanwhile this is simply not necessarily the case in Japanese. Similar to other world languages, such as Spanish etc. a person, animal, etc, need not be the actor of the sentence.

This is best illustrated with

私はコーヒーが好きだ

Sure, in English this is "I like coffee", this is more accurately translated as "As for me, coffee is pleasing" It is perfectly fine to have コーヒー being the main actor of the sentence here! This is how myths such as は can mark the subject of a sentence is incorrect! It is just a topic marker, the topic of the sentence is precisely the コーヒー here, and marked by が!

Furthermore, すきだ isn't a verb "to like", it is an adjective "is pleasing”. Through this framework, everything makes perfectly logical sense.

Example:

私は本が分かる

"to me, the book is understandable", the verb 分かる＝わかる means "to be clear or understandable". Through this framework everything makes perfect sense!

## Expressing desire for nouns

ほしい is an **adjective** which assigns the property of wantedness, i.e. it means wanted-is

So 私わ子猫がほしい

"As for me, the (child) cat is wanted"

i.e. "I want the cat"

## Wanting to do something - desire with verbs

If we want to do something, we need to 'conjugate' a verb to its い stem for Godan verbs, or apply the usual rules for Ichidan verbs, then add the helper adjective which indicates wanting たい, this doesn't mean **want**, but it is an adjective to mean "is desired"

See [['Conjugations' of verbs]] for the い stem rules

If we have no が, and we just say たべたい, well then the actor of the sentence is exactly what we would have thought it would have been all along, the speaker, me, I!


## Emotions
Generally, with たい and ほしい and any other set of emotions, wants etc, we can only express **our own** emotions. I mean, how could we know what works in the mind of another person anyway!

If we wanted to attempt to do so, we have to modify the adjectives

たい, 怖い(こわい)、ほしい

by dropping the い and replace it with がる. This helper verb means "to show signs of"

Hence:

桜がケーキをほしがる

would mean "Sakura, cake, she shows signs of wanting"

i.e. "Sakura wants to eat cake"

You might ask, why do we use a verb when describing other people and an adjective when describing our own feelings? Well that's because we can't describe precisely the quality of other people's feelings! But we can decide what they are showing signs of. From this point it is logical!
