Let's instead call it what it is, a **receptive helper verb**

This is a verb which fits onto the あ stem of another verb (see [['Conjugations' of verbs]])

and we add れる for Godan verbs and られる for Ichidan verbs.

We might be scared about られる being the same as the potential form for Ichidan verbs, but this is okay! Its just a homophone, you'll pick it up from context and the surrounding sentence.

This means the subject of the sentence receive or gets what the action of the verb is!

Example: 𠮟る=しかる＝to scold.

So if we want to say that さくら is receiving a scolding (or will) in the dictionary form we need to transform 𠮟るinto its あ stem, 𠮟ら and then we would say would say

さくらが𠮟られる

(notice actually that any Godan verb ending in る, will always pick up られる when putting it in the receptive form. So there is actually no difference between Ichidan and Godan verbs here!)

Now in an actual Japanese sentence, we need to say **when** it is happening! -られる acts as an Ichidan verb now, so we apply the basic rules

If she is getting a scolding **right now**, we'd say this as

さくらが𠮟られている。

or if she **was** scolded

さくらが𠮟られた。

of if she **was being scolded**

さくらが𠮟られていた。

Example:

The following comment makes a good point
![[0lTQhp5 1.png]]
(Note 蹴る＝ける＝to kick, is a Godan verb)
ゆこ＝優

We could have ゆこさんが私に蹴った, although this is a bit of an obtuse sentence. Usually one would say something like "I received a kick from Yuko", hence the discussion on the comment.

Now the thing is に is more like being used as Z-targeting here. Here we have I, me the subject of the sentence, then we are modifying 蹴られた to discern who is doing it, well, its Yuko! So we need to mark her as the target with に. Hence ゆこさんに蹴られた

Another way to think about it is, に only actually marks a physical target if its a **push** verb but in the receptive form we have a **pull** verb, so に is marking where the pull is coming from
