Let us analyse some first proper sentences

ある日アリスは川のそばにいた。

"One day, speaking of Alice, (it)-near the river, she was there"
or in more plain English
"One day, Alice was near the river."

The core structure of this sentence is ０がいた "there she was", she referring to Alice, on this particular day, as indicated by the topic marker.

Recall from [[Lesson 6 - Adjectives in Japanese]], we can turn any verb into an adjective when paired with a noun, by placing it to the left. For instance. We can have the sentence 本がある "the book exists", but we can also reverse this ある本が。。。although we need extra in the sentence. So here we are saying "that book (that exists)..."

The next sentence:

お姉ちゃんはつまらない本を読んでいて遊んでくれなかった。

- お姉ちゃん＝おねえちゃん="sister" (usually), teenage/ woman kind of depends, in this sense, "girl"
- つまらない=boring
- 読む=to read/will read (Godan)
- 遊ぶ=あそぶ＝to play (Godan)
- くれる＝give "down", i.e. to me or us. It can be giving a **thing** or an **action**.

So, lets find the core sentence, well there's kind of two here, but it might be best to think of it as nested? Upon reflection, there is most certainly two clauses, it is probably the most useful to say

０がいて+くれなかった

So we have A(０が)→B1て→B2

## Something new, compounding, the use of the て form

We shall specifically look at 読んでいて, this is **not** just the continuous past 読んでいた, we have something new, namely the use of て. If we take a clause (verb/verbial sentence whatever), and then place it in the て form, we are implying that something will **follow** this clause. So we essentially have the word 読んでいる. That is て is a connecting particle. Now since いる is an easy Ichidan verb, this becomes 読んでいて, and so the "reading of this boring book" is going to relate to the next clause in the sentence. 

This て is effectively functioning as "and" here. The tense ends up being indicated by the last verb

遊んでくれなかった。Let us analyse this conjugation.

This is **not** a negation of continuous past tense, that is, it is **not** 遊んでいなかった. (Obviously by inspection) Even though it **uses** the て form inside and there is the presence of past tense, you should **not** just assume that means the verb is being put into past tense!

This is **another** interesting use of the て form, together with the verb

Here we have

遊んで＋くれなかった

Now くれる here means to give (down), meanwhile あげる means to give (up)

Thus (action)+てくれる means to give down and (action)+てあげる to give up (to an other)

but what on earth is Alice giving here? Certainly not a gift or an object. Well since we have an action, it is whether this action is for one or another's **benefit**. 

If an action was done for **our** benefit, we may choose to add てくれる, while if it was for another's benefit てあげる. Well that's thinking of it personally, but of course, the subject of the sentence is not us here, but in some sense, Alice, who should be related to this sister.

So we are implying that playing 遊んでいる, would be to Alice's benefit. However, this did not happen since the big sister was simply reading. Hence the past tense negation, くれなかった.

Now let's translate this sentence into English:

"The big sister was reading a boring book, and wasn't playing." (was not playing for the purpose of Alice!)

Note that unlike English, we don't know what tense 読んでいて is in, until the end of the sentence where we see what verb it is attached to. However, in English, we require that we put the tense on both halves of the sentence (the clauses) here.
