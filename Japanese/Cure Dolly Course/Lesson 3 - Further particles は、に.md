# The は particle
This is commonly used in Japanese sentences, and is often confused to have the same function as が. This is **not** the case!

は can NEVER be part of the core sentence (A or B), nor can it be a 'white car' (as referred to by Dolly, i.e. other parts of the logical sentence)

It isn't a carriage, its not a logical particle. It's more of a flag simply to flag a topic, i.e. to provide context. Something like 私は is more like "as for me", we are marking 私 (わたし, me) as the topic of the following sentence.

So the sentence "I am American", which really should more aptly be when translated into English from Japanese, is "As for me, I am American", would be most obtusely written (informally) as

私は０がアメリカ人だ

However, due to the presence of the ０が (since indeed, the context is obvious since we even marked it with the sentence!), this would simply be said as

私はアメリカ人だ。

The common confusion with は is most easily seen in the joke where someone ordering food, say eel, will say

私は鰻だ。(鰻＝うなぎ=eel)

The uninformed reader would assume this person is saying "I am an eel", but this is in fact incorrect. A more apt translation would be "As for me, eel". To make the sentence clearer let's place this in a standard sentence structure, with ０が. We then have

私は０が鰻だ。

At this point, it becomes clear. "As for me, (the thing we are referring to from context - it, i.e. the order being made), eel."

Here the ０が functions as 'it', the **subject** of the conversation, referring to the order itself. Hence one is simply saying "As for me, the order, eel" i.e. "I will order eel". Which is a perfectly reasonable and logical Japanese sentence, and something that one might hear quite commonly.

Note: The subject and the topic of the sentence aren't necessarily the same! The topic is "me" here, while the subject is "the order".

# The に carriage
Here we have another logical particle which attaches to carriages in the sentence. に refers to a target.

Note that the position of logical particles in Japanese doesn't really create grammatically invalid sentences, although it most certainly would change the meaning of course, some of which might be nonsensical.
