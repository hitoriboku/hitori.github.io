## Sentence 1

「面白いことがない」とアリスは言った。

- 面白い＝おもしろい＝interesting
- 言う＝いう=to say/utter/declare
- もの=thing (concrete)
- こと=thing (abstract)
The new thing here is the **quotation particle** と. This is different from using と as **and**. Now of course when typing we can use quotation marks, but if we are saying that there was a quote, we use と.

## Sentence 2

その時、白いウサギが通りすぎた。
- 時＝とき＝time
- 白い＝しろい＝white (adjective)
- 通る＝とおる= to pass through
- 過ぎる＝すぎる＝to exceed/to surpass 

Note: that I am keeping the above as hiragana since we are attaching it onto the end - I'm not sure what is "best practice" here, if 過ぎる should be in kanji or not. Well, upon further reflection I think the answer is "it depends", se the use of 出す in [[Lesson 12 - The quotation particle と#Sentence 4|sentence 4]] where we clearly write it with kanji.

The new thing here is that we are using すぎる as a **helper verb** (see [[Lesson 10 - Main helper verbs - the potential helper verb|lesson 10]]) for the introduction. Here we need to put a verb in the い stem and then add すぎる (and then apply any tenses). In this context, it then means that the rabbit **goes beyond passing through**, so they must **pass by** (and leave).

## Sentence 3

ふつうウサギではなくて、チョッキを着ているウサギだった。

- チョッキ＝vest
- 着る＝きる＝to wear

Now let us analyse this

ふつうウサギではなくて is fairly simple, "it is not a normal rabbit", noting that we are dealing with a noun, hence why we use ではない. Moreover, since we are ending with なくて it is clear that we will have a compound sentence, this is leading into the next clause, so we don't know what tense this is in yet (spoiler alert, it will be past).

One thing to notice is that (without と) we would have an **adjectival noun** ふつうウサギではない. Now previously we only described how to use て with verbs, but the procedure is identical, we need to put it in the て form. Alas, we described that secretly previously in [[Lesson 7 - Negation#Negation of adjectives themselves|lesson 7]], we drop the い, replace it with く and then add て. This reveals to us that it is not just verbs that have a て form.

The rest of the sentence is easy, チョッキをきている is just saying "currently wearing the vest", i.e. it is the continuous present tense for wearing this vest, but we attach it to ウサギ so we are using it as an adjective, and then we end with だった, since we are describing the existence of the rabbit, with all these additional clauses. (It is at this stage we also now know the full tense of the sentence). Thus "The vest-wearing rabbit, existed".

The full sentence is then

"It is not an ordinary rabbit, it was a vest-wearing rabbit."

## Sentence 4

ウサギはかいちゅうどけいを見て「遅い！遅い！」と言って、走り出した。

- 遅い＝おそい＝late
- 懐中時計＝かいちゅう時計＝かいちゅうどけい＝pocket watch

Now we know that we can modify nouns with other nouns via の or な (the な actually being a modified version of だ and well this is for adjectival nouns...) but in this case, we are not modifying a noun, but creating a new noun, modifications of the actual nouns aren't needed like with verbs (in which case we would put them into the い stem and modify), so if we want to put two nouns together, we... do just that, we concatenate them! We squish them together.

The reason とけい becomes どけい, is because of "ten-ten-hooking". Since we are merging two nouns, but the second one begins with a **sharp** sound, we need to make it **dull**, hence the use of a ten-ten to make it a dull sound.

again notice the presence of the て form of 言って, thus we are saying the rabbit "said" and "ran".

Again for 走り出した, we are placing the verb 走る into its い stem, adding 出す which means to break out/to come out. So we are saying he "broke out into a run" (whilst speaking). We are implying this running was sudden.

## Sentence 5

「ちょっと待ってください」とアリスは呼んだ。

- ちょっと待って＝ちょっとまって＝"wait!"
- 呼ぶ＝よぶ＝to call out

It is interesting to note that ください, really is asking (politely) "please give down". So in the framework of the last lesson, Alice is asking

"A little bit, wait - give down"

the core verb here is 持つ, but we put this in the て form, its a Godan verb in the うつる group, hence it becomes 待って, what are we pairing it with? くれる！Although it is made as a polite request, thus becoming ください. So we are really saying "please, for the benefit of **me** (the main actor of the sentence), wait a little."

Since this is so common, sometimes when we put a verb in the て form on its own, we are saying a little more impolitely verb+てください, so something like ちょっと待って, is a less polite way of asking someone to please wait.

As for 呼んだ, note that we are simply placing the verb 呼ぶ into its た form, since it is part of the ぬぶむ group. If we only wrote this with ひらがな, then we would have よんだ, try not to get this confused with 読んだ! They are both the past tenses of ぬぶむ group verbs!! However, it is pretty clear from context what we mean, nonetheless, kanji can save the day if need be.

## Sentence 6

でもウサギはピョンピョンと走りつづけた。

- 続ける＝つづける= to continue

Again, we are just modifying 走る, turning it to its い stem, and then modifying the verb with つづける to say that the rabbit is continuing to run.
## What と actually does

What と does, is take everything before it, and then turns it into a single noun. It need not just apply to quotations. Thus と makes the noun act as a modifier for whatever the following verb is.

So the と here is saying the ピョンピョン feeling or more accurately **sound** of the rabbit is then being treated as a noun using と, and then added to the verb.
