**most of the time** this these concepts overlap, but sometimes the word transitive/intransitive is overused and overapplies to the actual concept we are talking about here: self-move and other-move verbs.

A Move-word is a verb = 動詞＝どうし

A self-move verb moves the self, an other move verb moves another

Example:

出る=でる to leave/exit/come out

出す=だす=to take out/bring out

these have identical base kanji, and a similar meaning, but different endings. Usually this all stems from ある (self-move) (to do) and する (other-move) (do)

Example:

負ける＝まける＝to lose (be defeated)

負かす=まかす＝to cause (another) to lose

There are a few simple rules which cover most of the self-move/other-move pairs

ある is existence, you can only be within yourself - hence the stem of self-move verbs

する is to do, this requires the existence of an other - hence the stem of other-move verbs

## The three *laws* of move-word pairs

These are some tricks which allow us to help work out what the structure of averb should look like
- する family law: す and せる ending verbs are other-move
- ある family law: あ-stem+る (ある) ending verbs are self-move
- Flip-switch law: え-stem+る (える) flips self-/other-move either way
- Honorary 4th law: む→める⇒めるis always other-move
