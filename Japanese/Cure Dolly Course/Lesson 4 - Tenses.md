# Tenses
## non-past tense 
(equivalent to the dictionary form of English verbs)
	-The most natural way this maps onto is "will do" (without the verb to be). This is then solved with いる (living things) and ある (inanimate objects)

Introduction to 'white engines', i.e. engines within a sentence, not just carriages

## Continuous present
This is actually identical to English in a way. If we want to say "Sakura is walking" in English, we have a key thing here. We have the subject, Sakura, the verb of being, **is** and the form of the word *walk* for the present tense, namely **walking**

We don't say "sakura is walk" (which would be さくらがたべるいる) (which would be of course, **wrong**)

Japanese is quite similar, we would say
さくらが**あるいて***いる*
The point is that we place the verb in its **te** (て) form + **iru** いる (4 different ways)

To make this more transparent, we have the **subject**
さくら
but of course, remember Japanese is a system with carriages and engines with particles attached. Thus we have
さくらが
Now what is she doing? She **is** *walking*
thus we say *あるいて+**いる**, あるいている！

In terms of carriages and engines, we think of　あるいて as a **white engine**, it exists to **modify** the main ending verb *いる*

For instance, we have

いぬが＋**たべて**+いる

The **core** sentence here is いぬがいる. "The dog is", but たべて is modifying this, what is it doing? it is たべて-ing! Hence たべている.

Precisely **how** we put a verb in its て form will be the subject of the next lesson [[Lesson 5 - Conjugation of verbs to the て and た forms]]]

# Past tense
The is in some sense simpler, of course still noting that this is all in the **casual form** (which is what children learn first anyway to understand the grammar of Japanese)

To talk about the past tense of a verb, we simply place it in the た form. Now there are variations of how one does this, it is not always as simple as attaching た, but nonetheless it follows **identical** rules as to how て attaches to verbs (with the only difference being that the e sound becomes an a sound.)

Cannot confirm yet, but I believe that putting in **past tense** makes a word **adjectival**.
# Future tense
## Relative future expressions
Since non-past tense can be thought of 'will do', then we can just mark the topic as something relative to the present time. 

For example
明日ケーキを食べる
means
"Tomorrow, I will eat cake."

The only thing being done here is just the inclusion of the **relative** modifier (time car) 明日 (あした), since it is relative to **now**

Again, if we want to be precise about the logic of the sentence structure, this is really
明日(０がケーキをたべる). Remember still, the **core sentence** here is ０がたべる, that is the subject (implied by context), will be eating. We just added a **modifier** to indicate relative time and added a carriage onto the sentence, ケーキ.

## Non-relative future expressions
However, if we want to use a non-relative time indication, we use に to mark the topic. This is identicatl to English! If we want to say something with a non-relative time expression we say something like '**on**' Monday, 'at' 6, '**in**' July etc.

The simple thing about Japanese is that we don't need all these different modifiers, we just say に! Everything else is the same and the rest of the sentence proceeds just like relative future expressions, where we are simply using the non-past tense. (Again, recalling that non-past essentially functions as 'will do'.) 

So if one wants to say "On Tuesday, I will eat cake", and we further assume that "I" is implied in the sentence. Then we would say

火曜日にケーキをたべる

or more obtusely

火曜日に０がけーきをたべる。

(Note: 火曜日＝かようび).

Again, the subject here is ０が, we modify the time of the sentence with the **absolute time** modifier 火曜日に, and enrich the sentence by saying what is being eaten, namely,　けーき！
