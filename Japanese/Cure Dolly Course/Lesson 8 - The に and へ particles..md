Now remember, logical particles can **only** mark nouns. There are times where we use particles like に with verbs, such as 買いに→ etc, this is because turning a verb into its い stem on its own can make it a noun. (See [['Conjugations' of verbs]])

## The に particle
に marks a destination

For example:

０さくらにボールを投げた

(０) to Sakura, with the ball, threw

i.e. () "threw the ball at Sakura"

お店に行く (should be ０がお店に行く)

that is I (or whoever ０) is, goes to the shops.

We can also mark subtler targets, such as

(０が)お店にたまごを買いに行く

The core sentence here is still ０が行くbut we are modifying it with particles, we are going **to the shops**, for the purpose of **buying eggs**, but also we are **not**, buying, or will buy, or bought, we are going 行く strictly **for the purpose of buying**, or **to buy**, thus we really should be modifying 行く！ Hence why we turn 買う into a noun, 買い and then add the particle marker to modify 行く. Simple!

We can also mark where things are with に! Think of this as a **past** target

For instance

０が公園にいる - i.e. 公園にいる (公園＝こうえん＝park)

"I am at the park"

Finally に can mark the target of a transformation.

For example さくらわかえるになった

"On the subject of Sakura, she became a frog" (a frog, she became)

Example: "Later it will become cloudy"

後で曇りになる

more precisely

後で＋０が＋曇りに＋なる

後で

After+(it)+cloudy-to+will become

"After, cloudy, it will become"

(literally just translate everything into Yoda speak)

## The secret く particle

If we want to use a target with an adjective (e.g. Sakura will become beautiful) we can't attach に onto an adjective, only nouns! So we need to turn 美しい (うつくしい=beautiful) into a noun and we do this with く! In order to do so, we need to turn 美しい into its regular adjective stem.

Recall from [[Lesson 6 - Adjectives in Japanese]] that the way we do this for adjectives is simple, we take off the い and replace it with く. Now く for an adjective is marking a target. Of course, such a sentence isn't done yet, we need to pair it with something if someone is 'becoming' beautiful. If they **will** become beautiful, then we can just use なる, the non-past tense. If they **became** beautiful, we want to use past tense, なった, if they are becoming beautiful right now, it should be なっている. This is because なる is an easy Ichidan verb.

Hence "Sakura will become beautiful" is

桜が美しくなる

or "Sakura became beautiful" is

桜が美しくなった。
## The へ particle

The へ particle is very simple and **only** marks the target when a is **going** to b, usually **by** some means of something. It cannot perform any of the other functions that に can.
