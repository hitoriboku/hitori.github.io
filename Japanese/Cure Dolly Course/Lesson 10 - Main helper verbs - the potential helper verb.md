Refer to [['Conjugations' of verbs]] for the verb conjugation tables.

Helper verbs, are verbs, that attach to verbs!

The potential helper verb has **two** forms, they attach to the え-stem version of a verb. They are

- る (for Godan verbs)
- られる (for Ichidan verbs - of course we want it to be different from the dictionary form, hence the different ending!)
This attaches the **able** property to a verb. 

There are only **two** exceptions for 来る(くる) and する. These become こられる and する becomes できる

Note that these are Ichidan helper verbs, thus even if a verb was a Godan verb, after it has now become an Ichidan verb in any further manipulations

For instance "walk is possible" would be

歩く（あるく）→歩ける（あるける）

If we want to now say 

"it was possible to walk" we'd write 歩けた（あるけた), or if its not possible 歩けない（あるけない）remember this is now an adjective! And then if we want negative past, i.e. "It was not possible to walk" we are no longer applying verb rules, but adjective rules, recall that we drop the い and　add かった, hence we get 歩けなかった=(あるけなかった).

Note that since helper verbs, attach to verbs and not adjectives, we can't do something like (can't walk) first and then apply potentiality. If we negate 歩くfirst, then we get 歩かない since we should use the あ stem, and we could make it past 歩かなかった but nonetheless, its an adjective here! We can't make it a potentiality, adjectives don't have potential, verbs do!

Notice this problem of 'attempted commutativity' would also appear before this. Consider the past tense of 歩く, this would be 歩いたif you were silly, you'd treat this as a verb and try apply certain conjugation rules to negate this, but of course there **are** no rules for negations of verbs which are not in their dictionary form, so it would be fruitless. Now this is an **adjectival verb**, it is functionally an adjective, so we could consider applying adjectival negation rules. However, we only know these for い and な adjectives so far (and Cure dolly only actually mentions い adjectives, since な adjectives are adjectival nouns)), so we actually don't have the presence of any negation rules to apply! Since we have hit a dead end, this is **not** the way to usually go, we could just add ない or something, but this would result in unnatural (although probably understandable) Japanese.

Working out **when** to negate seems a bit difficult here. Since for あるけなかった　(it was not possible to walk in the past) we are first applying the potentiality verb, then the negation verb "so it is not possible" and then finally the tense. I am unsure what the **rule** should be here, perhaps that tenses come last? (Which intuitively makes sense), I'm not sure what would need to be done for more complex operations.
